    <h1>Welcome to Danaish Danial's Page!</h1>
    <img src="Danish Danial 150.png" alt="Placeholder image">
    <p>Hello there! I'm Danaish, a 7th grade student at <a href="https://bcemschool.com/">Bethlehem Community English Medium School, Nemmara</a>. Our principal is Ms. Praveena, and I've been learning coding from Ms. Dilja Suji.</p>
    <p>I'm a big fan of football and my favorite player is <span class="highlight">Christiano Ronaldo</span>. I admire his skills and dedication to the game. When I'm not playing football, you can find me cycling around my neighborhood. It's not just a great way to stay fit, but I also love the feeling of freedom when I'm riding.</p>
    <p>My dad, Mr. Dainal Prasad, is a supervisor. My cousins, Vaishnav & Viswajith, have a hardware shop at Pezhumpara Junction. You can find it on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XuPBvp5CTGHgGTDY9">Google Maps</a>.</p>
    <p>Whether it's on the football field or on the open road, I'm always looking for my next adventure. Thanks for visiting my page!</p>
