    <h1>Welcome to Danaish Danial's Page!</h1>
    <img src="Danish Danial 150.png" alt="Placeholder image">
    <p>Hello there! I'm Danaish, a 7th grade student who loves sports and being active. I'm a big fan of football and my favorite player is <span class="highlight">Christiano Ronaldo</span>. I admire his skills and dedication to the game.</p>
    <p>When I'm not playing football, you can find me cycling around my neighborhood. It's not just a great way to stay fit, but I also love the feeling of freedom when I'm riding.</p>
    <p>Whether it's on the football field or on the open road, I'm always looking for my next adventure. Thanks for visiting my page!</p>
